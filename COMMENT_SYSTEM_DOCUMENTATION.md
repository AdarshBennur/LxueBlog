## Usage Instructions

### For Developers

1. **Adding Comments to Any Page**:
   ```astro
   ---
   import CommentSection from '../components/CommentSection.astro';
   ---
   
   <CommentSection postId="your-post-id" />
   ```

2. **Dynamic Post ID Updates**:
   The component automatically listens for `updatePostId` events:
   ```javascript
   const event = new CustomEvent('updatePostId', { 
     detail: { postId: articleId } 
   });
   document.dispatchEvent(event);
   ```

### For Content Moderators

1. **Comment Approval**: Guest comments and regular user comments require approval
2. **Admin/Author Comments**: Automatically approved and published immediately
3. **Moderation Interface**: Use the existing admin panel to approve/reject comments

## Styling & Theme Integration

The comment system uses the existing color palette:
- **Primary Colors**: Gold (#D4B483), Cream (#F9F5EB), Sand (#E5DCC5)
- **Text Colors**: Charcoal (#2D2A24), Mocha (#7D6E5B)
- **Accent Colors**: Rose (#F6E6E4), Sage (#CAD2C5)
